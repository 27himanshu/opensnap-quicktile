OPENSNAP
==========

What's that?
------------
It tries to bring to aero snap like features to openbox.

Does this work with other window managers?
------------------------------------------
I don't know, the goal was to make it work with every EWMH compilant window manager. But I can't be bothered to try it out :)

So how can I use it?
-------------------
make
bin/opensnap -h
should tell you all you need to know.
Don't forget to copy the sample configs to ~/.config/opensnap/
And edit them. They'll tell you what you need to edit.

Dependencies?
-------------
You'll need wmctrl with the default config. On most debian systems you should be able just just
apt-get install wmctrl
